 - New Authorities - Abh Kingdom is traditional monarchy, while Abh Empire has oligarchic elections
 - Embracing factions for Abh states now don't change ethos, but give temporary focus modifiers - Ideologies
 - Resources for Abh megastructures are now taken from system planets gradually (same mechanics as Aggressive Mineral Extraction)
 - If there's not enough resources, player is prompted to allocate additional minerals for construction
 - Added Imperial Habitat megastructure which can be built only with Voidborn AP - it's of maximum size and does not decay as common Abh habitats.
